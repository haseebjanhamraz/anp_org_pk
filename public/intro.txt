The Awami National Party (ANP) has its origins rooted in the socio-political struggles of Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan, famously known as Bacha Khan. He was a prominent Pashtun leader who, during the British colonial period, advocated for nonviolent resistance and established the Khudai Khidmatgar (Servants of God) movement in 1929. This movement was revolutionary, promoting nonviolence, justice, and unity within the Pashtun community, while challenging the oppressive British colonial system.
The Khudai Khidmatgar movement quickly gained popularity, mobilizing thousands of Pashtuns in British India and aligning ideologically with the Indian National Congress. Bacha Khan and his followers embraced the Congress’s philosophy of peaceful resistance, with a vision of an independent and united India. Bacha Khan opposed the partition of India due to fears it would divide the Pashtun nation and disrupt harmony among communities. As a result, he and his supporters found themselves politically isolated following the creation of Pakistan in 1947.
Despite their opposition, Bacha Khan and his supporters continued to advocate for Pashtun rights and regional autonomy within Pakistan. However, their stance against partition often led to persecution and political restrictions, especially as Pakistan’s government sought to centralize power. These events laid the foundation for a legacy of Pashtun nationalism and secular political activism that would later define the Awami National Party.
